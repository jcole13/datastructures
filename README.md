# datastructures

There are two implementations of data structures in this repository.
The calculator(main method in runner) takes in user input in either infix or postfix notation, and the user can 
choose to either calculate to expression or convert the expression into the other notation. 

The graph(main method in runner) takes in user input, and the user can search for the inputted person either with a breadth first search or a depth first search. The adjacency list is the store of graphnodes, which hold people, and the connections to those graphnodes, with are unidirectional.
